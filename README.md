It outlines the architecture and implementation of a data pipeline designed to handle the generation, ingestion, storage, transformation, and visualization of data. The infrastructure is built using a modern data stack that leverages cloud services and open-source tools for scalability, security, and efficiency.
## Components Breakdown

### 1. **Data Generation**
- **EC2 Instance (Python Script)**
  - **Description:** An Amazon EC2 instance running a Python script generates synthetic data every 2 hours.
  - **Purpose:** Simulates real-time data generation for testing and development purposes.
  - **Location:** Public subnet within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

### 2. **Data Storage**
- **Amazon RDS Postgres**
  - **Description:** A Postgres database hosted on Amazon RDS stores the data generated by the EC2 instance.
  - **Purpose:** Acts as the primary storage for generated data.
  - **Location:** Private subnet within the VPC for enhanced security.

### 3. **Data Ingestion**
- **Airbyte**
  - **Description:** Airbyte is responsible for ingesting new data from the RDS Postgres database on a daily basis.
  - **Purpose:** Extracts data from the operational database and loads it into the data warehouse.

### 4. **Data Warehouse**
- **Snowflake**
  - **Description:** Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehouse where ingested data is stored.
  - **Purpose:** Provides scalable and efficient storage for large datasets, allowing for fast query performance.

### 5. **Data Transformation**
- **dbt (Data Build Tool)**
  - **Description:** dbt transforms raw data within Snowflake into a usable format.
  - **Purpose:** Prepares data for analysis by cleaning, aggregating, and organizing it.
- **Apache Airflow**
  - **Description:** Airflow schedules and orchestrates dbt jobs to ensure data is refreshed daily.
  - **Purpose:** Automates the transformation process to maintain up-to-date data in the warehouse.

### 6. **Data Visualization**
- **Looker**
  - **Description:** Looker connects to Snowflake to provide interactive data visualizations and dashboards.
  - **Purpose:** Enables stakeholders to explore and analyze data through an intuitive interface.

### 7. **CI/CD, Version Control, and Infrastructure as Code**
- **GitHub & GitHub Actions**
  - **Description:** GitHub is used for version control, and GitHub Actions automates CI/CD processes.
  - **Purpose:** Manages code and infrastructure changes, ensuring consistency and reliability.
- **Docker**
  - **Description:** Docker is used for containerizing applications, ensuring consistent environments.
  - **Purpose:** Facilitates deployment across different environments.
- **Terraform**
  - **Description:** Terraform is used for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision cloud resources.
  - **Purpose:** Automates the setup and management of infrastructure in a repeatable manner.
